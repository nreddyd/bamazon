still working on updating the screenshots.

Bamazon is Amazon-like storefront CLI created using javascript, node and MySQL.

The node app bamazonCustomer.js will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The user will be prompted to select the product they would like to buy and the quantity of the purchase. If the item is in stock the order will be completed and the total amount of the purchase will be logged else "insuffecient stock" will be logged.
